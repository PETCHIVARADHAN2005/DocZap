🔍 What is DocZap?
DocZap is a doctor-centric healthcare management system designed to digitize hospital operations and enable seamless communication between patients, doctors, and administrators. It provides dedicated portals for each user type, focusing on real-time appointment scheduling, secure online payments, doctor availability management, and comprehensive profile management.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
DocZap aims to modernize hospital workflows by building a robust full-stack platform where:

✅ Patients can book appointments and manage their health profiles online.
✅ Doctors can oversee their schedules, earnings, and patient appointments.
✅ Admins maintain complete control over operations, doctor onboarding, and overall system oversight.




By replacing manual booking processes, DocZap reduces patient wait times and significantly improves operational efficiency and data security for hospitals.
